 * different object. This connector is one long-lived main process serving every chat through
 * one manager, so the same session ids are in scope everywhere, and `write_stdin(session_id)`
 * on a numeric id from another chat would otherwise reach that chat's shell.
 *
 * This is an authorization boundary. A proven owner can only be continued by that same proven
 * conversation. Legacy/single-chat calls that carry no request identity are kept in a separate
 * anonymous bucket so existing terminal semantics still work, but a later proven chat cannot
 * adopt such a session and an anonymous call cannot touch a proven-owned session.
